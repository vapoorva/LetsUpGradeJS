Data Types in JS

There are basic seven primitive Types of Datatypes

1. Number: It represents both integers nd floating point numbers.
eg: let n=10;

2.String:This stores statements using single,double quotes
eg:let str = "Hello";
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';

3.Boolean: The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
eg:let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked

4.null value: It contains only null values.
eg: let age = null;

5.undefined: The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined.
eg: let age;
alert(age); // shows "undefined"

6.object: this is used for complex data structures

7. symbol : used for unique identifiers
